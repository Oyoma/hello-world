Learning how to use Github

My name is Oyoma and I am an aspiring Data Scientist. I have obtained a degree in Computer Science and Information Technology (B.Sc) and Information Systems Management (M.Sc).
Data Science became an interest of late and I have began by brushing up my Data Analytic Skills with Excel and SQL and taking up lessons on data science/machine learning. I also got to know about Github, as a platform for versioning and publishing codes. So at the time of writing this, I am following the Github guide. I have learnt how to create a repository and a branch. I am now learning how to commit changes on Github.
